# Command to run:
# 1. Start a terminal in your repo folder 
# 2. Then write:
  # sbt "run modelardb.conf"

# 3. Then start another terminal and send your queries in a manner simlar to:
  # curl -d "select * from datapoint limit 10" localhost:9999
  # curl -d "select AVG_S(#) from Segment" localhost:9999
  #curl -d "select START_TIME, AVG_S(#) from Segment group by TID, START_TIME" localhost:9999
  
  
# Until furhter notice don't test it on spark just use h2. 

#TODOs:
# Setup some input data i.e. modelardb.source should be set to some CSV file
	# Examples are in the bottom under CSV Format Settings
	# TIMESTAMP ; VALUE (would be a simple CSV.example maybe just create our own or see if we can find something)
	# TIME-SERIES GENERATION
# Also remeber to setup amount of ingestors, after having set some input:
	# modelardb.ingestors 1
# IMPORTANT: remeber to set sampling_interval to the correct value
	# modelardb.sampling_interval 100
# Then after the data has been loaded we can do some queries on localhost:9999 if we enable:
	# modelardb.interface http
	# Here we can send and SQL-query to the HTTP-endpoint



# Everytime you write "sbt run" then it appends the data to the h2 output-file
